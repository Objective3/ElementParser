	Chunk is a range of source text that has been divided into a meaningful "chunk" by
	the NSString_HTML parser. Examples of a chunk include an element, a cdata section, an entity, 
	character data, etc. It is an abstract base class that handles basic housekeeping.
	Subclasses include TagChunk, TxtChunk, CommentChunk, EntityChunk, etc.
